Space Ghost Coast-to-Coast

ETL Proposal

Alex Brown/Justin Parker

Datasets:

DSN Now: Website, pulling a few distinct pieces of info
Gmaps api: showing location of DSN site
Nasa Missions page: Showing active missions for spacecraft, or relevant information

Final Use:

Linking spacecraft with which the DSN is currently sending information to relevant information to that spacecraft or its current mission and providing an api for people to pull that information from one spot as a json file.


Database type:
Non-relational because information response will be varied based on the craft.
